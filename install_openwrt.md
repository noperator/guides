**Note:** I've flashed/installed this software before but didn't document my steps at the time. Until then, I've just got instructions to perform a factory reset as that's what I've done most recently.

Perform a [Factory Reset](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/troubleshooting/failsafe_and_factory_reset#factory_reset); i.e., erase all your packages and settings, returning the router to its initial state after installing OpenWrt.
```
firstboot
reboot now
```
